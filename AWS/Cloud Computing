ADVANTAGES
    No need to maintain own datacenter. As one can hire it over the internet 
    No need to spend on hardware and can demand it online over network 
    Pay for only those resource which are utilized 
    

Where does cloude come 
    Its nothing but multiple machine connected over network which is prexist even before it termed as clode. 
    So whatare these multiple things its like softwares,devices, platform, infrastructure aver the internet is termed as internet and 
    we are going to access it 
    
WHAT IS THE CLOUDE COMPUTING 
  Cloude computing is on demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications and other it resources through cloude service 
  platform via the internet with pay as you go pricing. 
  
  SO : 
       1 On demand delivery of compute power database storage and other it resources : such as hardware hard drive space for storage, cpu for calculations or deployment, preexist deployed application over cloude
       2 Over-internet : Means no need of any instrastructure/installation/softwares on local machine it would be need on browser and 
         internet connectivity to access the cloide services 
       3 Pay as you Go: so user has to pay for amount of period services consumed. No need to pay for terminated services or 
         unutilized resources as well as hardware
  
  
  
 CHARACTERITICS OF CLOUDE COMPUTING 
 
      1. On demand self service :  Basically allows user to use webserices and resources  on demand so whenever you need you'll use it.
                                   We can logon to website anytime you need it.
      2. Broad network access :    Since theser services are accessed over internet you can access anytime anywher on any device connected to internet.
                                   No restriction on where and what time one can access these servie 
      3. Location independent resource pooling :                          
                                   Cloude computing allows multiple user to share a pool of resources so there can be multiple users 
                                   who are going to share physical instace of project or they would be sharing database or any other 
                                   infrastructure. So all of these will be sharing among the multiple user.
                                   So suppose there is instance that on user using at particular time would be available to other as soon 
                                   as user release it. So shared among the multiple user 
      4. Rapid Elasticity :        It is very easy scalable i e if you require you need more number of instace/resources at some moment for example 
                                   you have website running on cloude and suddenly there is high demad and access to application/website int 
                                   that case you need more number of servers to serve the large no requests that is goint to required you to 
                                   provision more no of servers but with cloude computing you need to worry it is going to scale up as per the
                                   demand. So scaling on the resources is either incrreasing it or decreasing it. tHAS WHY it called as elastic 
                                   it can shring or grow. Say for any ecommerce application sales grow up duting fetival so the no of resources or 
                                   servers instances can grow up and once festival over it can scale down to original 
      5. Measured Service  :       In this service cloude provider controls and monitor all the aspects of service. 
                                   Such as Resource Optimisation 
                                           Billing and capacity planning everything depend on what services you are going to user 
                                           
                                   
 CLOUDE COMPUTING ARCHITECTURE: It comprises of two parts which is Front end and Backend    
                                Front End basically comprises of client side part such as web browsers which will going to access the cloude
                                computing devices which are present in the backend. 
                                The front end connected to backend via Internet. 
                                Backend is basically cosist of resouces that are rquired of cloude computing services it could be either 
                                virtual machine databases or storages etc under the cloude provider control.
                                So either for example storate or compute distributed across multiple machine in backend   
 CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE : cloud infrastructure consist of 
                               Hypervisor 
                               Management software Deployment software 
                               Storage Servers Network etc at backend at service provider side 
                               Hypervisor: Hupervisor usually used in order to do the virtual machine management. it allows to share single specific
                               instace of cloude resource to serverla channels 
 CLOUDE INFRASTRUCTURE CONTRAINTS :  
                               Transperancy
                               Scalibility 
                               Intelligent Monitoring 
                               Security 
                      
                               
CLOUD DEPLOYMENT MODEL : Cloud deployment model is specific type of environment distinguished based on the ownership, size and access.
                         Ownership : who owns the cloud 
                         Size : various type of resources engaged in cloud
                         Access :  how one can access the cloud network 
                        Common type of Cloud deployment are 
                        Public cloud
                        Private cloud
                        communiity cloud
                        Hybrid cloud
         Public cloud : 
         Public cloud allows system and services to be easily accessible to general public 
         It giant such as google amazon microsoft offer clode services via interbet 
         The clode service provider responsible for creation and ongoing maitainance of the public clode and it resources 
         So what ever resoures which are present inside the cloude which goint to access by the users are maintained by cloud provider 
         BENEFITS of PUBLIC CLOUD: 
         Cost Effective: Since public cloud shares same resources with large number of customer it goung to be inexpensive  
         Relibility: Public cloud employes large no of resources from differnt locations AZS if any resouce fail then public cloude can employe another resource. For example if you have say storage on cloud so data will be stored on mutliple locatoin and. Data wont be loss
         Flexibility: In public cloud you can force to integrate with private clode which gives customer a flexible approch. If you are going to have very secure and dont want to share which should not be access to any other user althouf public cloud have enough security for such data but user can have such data to be locate in private cloud which woudl be intedgrated with public cloud shared resouces.  
         Location Independance: Since it is available over internet it can be accessible from anywhere 
         Utility Style Costing: Oublic cloud is 
         High Scalibility: Cloud resources are available from the pool of resources and hence they can ne scale up or down as per requirment 
         DISADVANTAGE 
         Low security and lest cutomization 
         
         
         Private cloud:
         Private cloud allows system and services to be accessbile within the organisation 
		     The private cloud is operated only within a single organisation however it may be managed internaly by the organisation itself by a third party 
		     Either you can have on premises or on the cloud deployed 
	        If on premise then all of the hardware is also going to your premises and you only responsible for maitainting those 
          Or you can have it on private cloud which is goiunt to be managed by third party all the hard ware will be present on cloud provider location
          
         BENEFITS  
         High Security and Privacy : 
		     More control : The private cloude has more control over its resouces as compared to public cloud becoz access through within organisation  
         Cost and energy efficient: The private cld resources are not cost effective as  the resources in public cloud but they offer more energy efficiency than the public cloud
         Improved reliability: 
         DISADVANTAGE
         Limited Scalibiliy :Less scallable since resouces are privatly limited available 
         
         HYBRID CLOUD:
         IT is combination of public and privage cloud
         the critical operation performedn on private cloud and non critical on public cloud
         BEBEFITS/ ADVANTAGES 
         Scalibility: If you are using private cloud and suddenly there is raise in demand that case we can user public cloud to serve the demand 
         Securiry: you have secure data that could be saved on private cloud 
         Cost efficiencies: Public cloud are more cost effective than private therefore hybrid too
         Flexibility: Can use public resouces  
         DISADVANTAGE:
         You might have sec concern that is you need to ensure the cloud services are complient with the security policies of your own orgal
         also networking could be issue due mixing the public and private we might have somplex networking comlex firewall that you may need to user 
         in   order use hybrid deployment model 
         
         
         COMMUTNITY CLOUD
         Community cloud allows system and services to be accessed by the group of organisations
         it shared the infrastructure among the several organisation for specific community say schools 
          So whaterver schools presents withing say xyz community servicess would be available for those schools  
         it might be managed by the organisarion or by third party 
             
         BENEFITS ADVANTAGES
         WSince commutnity cloud offers same advantages as of private cloud but at less cost 
         Sharing among organisatoin ; Community cloud are cost effective which is similar to private cloud but and less cost effective 
         Security :  Private > Community > public 
         
         
CLOUD SERVICE MODELS
        Cloud service models are defined as capabilities to the user.
        There are 3 types of service model 
        1 Saas   Software as a service 
        2 Paas
        3 Iaas

        1 Saas: 
          Where are in softwares provided on demand such as gmail or sts it could be software would be available on demand 
        2 Paas: Platform as a service 
          Where in would for exampel say google app engine which provide you some platform which you could use for development 
          for instance you want to devlope some software then you do not need to install platform which you require for development on 
          local machine you can directly you have whenever required directly access via the browser and get it. Do not required to get 
          and installed it. Databases as Paas
        3 IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service 
          Whether you require copute power or network you can have resouces as required 
          We can have inftructure as a service 
                 
          
         SAAS :  
         Saas model allows softeware applicatio as service to end user 
         it refer to the
