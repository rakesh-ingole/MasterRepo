    So here Jenkins will checkout the code from the specified git repo which is hosted on git hub and fetch all the required files to workspace and perform command on it 
    
    What is workspace : Workspace is the place where jenkins performs active build. Each time new build created old one will be removed.
                        We can ispect it after build has run successfully 
                        
    
  Maven MODULES: Jenkins undertand multimodule maven projects and showcase same in jenkins dashboard
