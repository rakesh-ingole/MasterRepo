What is AI: Computer system able to perform tasks normally requiring human intteligence 
	
	visual perception 
	speach recognition
	language transformation	
	decision making 
	
Learning : Process from which system improves its performance from experienc study or being tought 
            Basic tasks : Classification, Categorisation/clustering, problem solving , planning control , predictions others 
            Example of classification : such as classifying humans as male female etc 
            Example of Clustering  : Grouping  customers in different segments or grpuping species 
            Example of Prediction : forcasting  outcome of process using data mining and probabeloity: forcastng revenue, customer churn or real estate prices 

    Two aspects of learning : trainign and testing 
      Training : is the aquicition of knowledge, skills, compitencies. It requieres examples or scenarios 
                 in case of ML it data 
      Testing :  To analyse how well the learned system works 
                  performance on unknown or unseen data or scenario. Basicalu to identify issues in learned system 
       Types of Dataset: 
                  Training set :  used for trainign and fitment of model
                  Validation set : used for model fine tuning and optimization
                  Testing Set :   used to get the unbaised estimate of the skill of the final tuned model 
                  

What is Machine learning : Looking pattern in vast amouny of data thay id just big for human to analyze 
                           it is the application that provides system ability to automatically learn and improve from experience 
                           whithout being explicitly programmed. 
                           It is the study of algoritm 
                           ML algorithm builds a mathematical model of sample data known as Training data in order to make predictions
                           or decisions withoud being explicitly programmed to perform the task 
                           
                           
              
 Approch of the Machine Learning : 
          Training and Testing 
          Traing : Traing data to Feature applied to ML algorithm = Created Model 
          Tesging : Test data to applu model(Learned during Training phase) = predictions 

Types Of Maching Learning 
    Supervised machine learning   
  
    Unsupervised Machine Learning 
    Reinforcement Learning 
    Supervised and Unsupervised are widely used 
    
    Supervised Machine LearningL: WEll labeled and classified 
                                   Lable data used to learn;exple say Dog picture which will if tested with cat will fail 
           Two Types 
            1. classification : exmaple    Support vector machines, Discriminian, Analysis, Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbour 
            2. Regression : examples Linear Regression GLM, Support Vector regression 
            
    Unsupervised Machine learning  : neither classified nor Labled.     
                                    Labelling is not required. Model learns by grouping data baed on the features    
            1. Clustering : example K-Means, K-Medoids, Fuzzy C-Means, Hierarchical 
            
            
     
    
Design maching learning systems are : 
    O=f(I): a target function f which is to be applied on input I to generate output O
    f-> is target function(Whta is to be learned)
    Chose how to represent target functionn
    Chose a learning algorithm to infer the target function from the training data set 
 
 

Learning Algorithm : 
    Learning algorithm use training values for the target function
    Learnig to approximate a continuous function is called *REGRESSION
    Learning algoritm attempts to minimize some measure of the error "e" (loss function) such as *MEAN SQUARE FUNCTION 
    
    **LOSS is number indicating how bad the model predictions was on a single example. Machine learn by means of a loss function. 
    its a method of evaluating how well specific algorithm models the given data.
    If prediction deviates to much from the actual resurlts then loss function would have shown higher value.
    Other examples of Loss : Mean Absolute Error, Hinge Loss, Cross Entropy Loss etc.

Machine learning and steps involved in it. HOW MACHINE LEARNIG WORKS 
  Step 1: Select Data->Selects the required data set: Some imp activities in this phase are 
                       Data collection, Data Clensing, Handlling missing data, imbalance and outliares, visualise the data, extracting data from data set
                       The trainig data splits into theree sets further The training, the validation and testing
  Step 2: Model Data-> An appropriate algorithm is selected to model the target function. The model is traind and fit using the exctract from the training data 
  Step 3: Validation Model-> The model is assed using the validation data for its performance using various parameters like accuricy precision etc
  Step 4: Test Model-> Model is tuned further to optimised performance and tested using test data 
  Step 5: Use the Model-> Once the  performance is satisfactory the model is deployed on production for inferencing unknown data  
  Step 6: Tune Model-> In production its performance monitored continuously The whole process is iterative to achineve the objective 
                       or retrain the model if the data set changed or performacne degraded 



ISSUES IN MACHINE LEARNING 
      What algorithm can approximate functions well and when 
      problem representation and feature extraction 
      intention/independent learning 
      transfer learning 
      scaling issues 
      limitations while handling unstructured data like images 

DEEP LEARNING 
      Deep learning is the artificial learning functions that immitate the working of the human brain in processin data and creating pattern for use ins decision making 
      Deep learning is one of the machine learning method based on Artificial nueral network 
      Deep learning uses a hirearchical level of artificial   nueral network to carry out process of machine learning 
      Deep is technical term.. It refers to the number of layers in neural network. A shallow network has one so-called hidden layer, and a deep network has more than one 
    
    Deep learning technichs categorised incrementally through its hidden layer architecture defining low level categories first then little 
    higher level categories.
    Example image recognition 
    
      Layer#1 : Algorithm first learn to recognise pixels and then edges and shapes 
    Layer#2 : Learns to identify more complex shapes and features like eyes and mouths 
    Layer#3 : Learns which shapes and objects can be used to idntify human face 

Human brain uses the patterns and features to identify the different objects  
On the other hand Artificial nueral network learn relations between cause and effect or organize large volumes of data into orderly and informative patterns 

ANN N BLN  SIMILARITY
 
 
ARCHITECTURE - A pattern of connections between neurons 
	
	Single layer feedforward network : Here input x1 and x2 passed directly to the output in forward direction and output is generated by multiplying weight
	Multi layer feedforward network : Multilayer neural network have one or more layer in between input and output.
					  Hidden layer extract implicit information by discovering relationships between the features in the i/p
	Recurrent neural network :  Both direction  eg language processing/translation 
	Convolutional neural network :
